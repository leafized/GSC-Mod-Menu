How to download.

# I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DOWNLOAD THE GITHUB CLIENT AND SET THE REPOSITORY ORIGIN TO YOUR PROJECTS FOLDER, SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS CLICK **PULL ORIGIN**

Instructions with the client.
==========
1. Make sure the repository is placed inside Projects > MW3 (This isn't the only game it supports, but to make things simple, make sure the repo folder is here.)
2. Click -  FETCH ORIGIN  - to grab the latest files, this will also store the previous version of the menu inside your directory.
3. Open the file in IL and verify that the config.il folder has the correct compiler symbols for the version you are using. (0.1a etc...) 
4. Click Config, select the game and mode, then click Inject.
==========

Instructions without the client.
==========
1. Click the green box labeled CODE , then click download as zip.
2. Extract the master folder into DOCUMENTS/INFINITY LOADER/PROJECTS/MW3/
3. Open the project in Infinity Loader and verify that the compiler symbols are correct for the latest version. If they aren't, delete the folder and reinstall.
4. Click Config, select the game and mode, then click Inject.
